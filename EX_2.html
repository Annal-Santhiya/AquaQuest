    <h3>Interesting Facts about fish</h3>
    <p>Fish are fascinating creatures that inhabit our oceans, rivers, and lakes. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, each adapted to their unique environments. Dolphins are "sleepwalkers," seahorses are the only animal where the male gives birth, or that octopuses have blue blood and three hearts. The oceans are incredibly diverse, with some jellyfish being older than dinosaurs, and certain fish like clownfish being sequential hermaphrodites. </p>
